<p>The application allows exporting of the GNSS log for the currently selected trip, all trips in the log file,
or all filtered trips (refer to <a href="eventFilter.html">Event Filtering</a>).
The export options are available from the application menu if a log file is loaded,
with the exception of the &#34;All trips (filtered)&#34; option which is only available if a filter has been applied.
Once selected, a file selection dialog is presented allowing the user to select the file to export to.</p>

<p>Exporting is in plain text (.csv) and is essentially a list of GNSS coordinates reported in all events
in a trip or trips. The exception being that if the GNSS location in an event is lat/long 0/0 the coordinate
is not reported as this is the default reported when there is no GNSS information</p>

<p>If exporting GNSS data for all trips is selected, all trips are exported to a single file.</p>

<p>If exporting data for all filtered trips is selected, all trips matching the filter are exported to a single file.
Note that trips mathcing the filter are always displayed in the Trip Data pane when the filter is applied.</p>

<p>An excerpt of a GNSS log .csv export for all trips is shown below.
Note that where a trip does not have any GNSS entries, that trip is not included in the export.</p>

<p>In the .csv log above there is a title row at the start of each trip.
Also, there is a <i>name</i> filed in the title, which for a Fleet Controller is the trip ID, and for
a Zoner is the Fleet ID of the controller.</p>

<h2>Plotting the GNSS Log Export</h2>
<p>The format of the GNSS log includes the time and latitude / longitude coordinates.
The log export can be plotted using third party online tools, for example, GPSVisuliser <a href="https://www.gpsvisualizer.com">https://www.gpsvisualizer.com</a>".
Using GPSVisuliser for the .csv GNSS log file above results in the following plot.</p>

<img src="./gnssLogPlot.png" alt="Sample GNSS log plot from https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/map_input?form=leaflet">

<p>Note in the sample plot above the legend, where individual tracks are shown for each trip.
Note that for Zoners only a single track is shown.</p>

<p>In the sample plot each track is assigned a different (random) colour, with a pin shown at the start of each track.
Note that if tracks are turned off using the legend that the track pin, which is a waypoint for the track, is still displayed.
